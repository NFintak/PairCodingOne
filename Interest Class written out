Class Interest{
/* For interest, what I want to do, is include calculated compound interest from Principle within the savings account. The equation is below, denoted in single letters, later determined from Nate’s variable names relating to the account. */

Variables are:
amount = amount after interest paid at the end of the statement period.
savingsAcct = Principle deposit/beginning statement period savings account balance. = 200,000
savingsRate = Compound Interest Rate —> 2% APY
time = 365 Days 
Compound Interest Dollars earned:  savingsAcct * (rate/time) = 10.39589041096 = savingsRate
Notes:

Time is equivalent to a month of time. However, interest is calculated daily until the statement period is over. In other words…
	amount = savingsAcct * (savingsRate / time)
	amount = 200,010.9589041096 —> End of month balance
}

Class Overdraft{
 /*`What I’m looking for, is that if the transaction, particularly with debit card transactions, is over $200. And, if it is, then we find out if it overdraws the account?
Q1: Is the debit card transaction $200 or more?
	•	If yes: Then review if the account holder has opted-in Reg E. 
	⁃	If yes: Then the debit card transaction is declined
	⁃	If no: Then the debit card transaction debits $200 from the checking account, thus overdrawing the account.
	•	If no: Communicate with account holder via either email or text message, that their checking acct overdrawn. */
